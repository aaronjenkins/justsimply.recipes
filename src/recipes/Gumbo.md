# Vegan Gumbo

# Ingredients
    - 3 tablespoons olive oil
    - ¼ cup all-purpose flower
    - 1 medium onion, diced
    - 1 green bell pepper, diced
    - 2 celery stalks, diced
    - 3 garlic cloves, minced
    - 1 can kidney beans
    - 4 cups vegetable broth
    - 1 (14 oz) can fire roasted tomatoes
    - 1 ½ cups fresh or frozen okra
    - 2 tablespoons Worcestershire (or A1) sauce
    - 2 teaspoons of paprika
    - 2 teaspoons of dried thyme
    - 1 teaspoon black pepper
    - 1 teaspoon dried oregano
    - Cayenne pepper to taste
    - Salt to taste
# For Serving
    - Cooked Rice
    - Chopped parsley or green onions
# Instructions
    - Coat the bottom of a large pot with the olive oil (3 tbsp) and place it over medium heat. Whisk in the flour ( ¼ cup). Cook the flour, whisking constantly, until it darkens in color a bit and begins to smell nutty, about 5 minutes.
    - Stir in the onion (1 whole, diced), pepper (1 whole, diced), celery (2 stalks, diced), and sauté for about 5 minutes, until the veggies begin to soften. Add the garlic (3 cloves, minced) and sauté about 1 minute more, until very fragrant.
    - Stir in the broth (4 cups), tomatoes (1 can), okra ( 1 ½ cups), kidney beans (1 can), Worcestershire sauce (2 tbsp), paprika (2 tsp), thyme (2 tsp), pepper (1 tsp), oregano (1 tsp), cayenne, and salt. Raise the heat and bring to a boil. Then lower the heat and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, until the broth is thick and the veggies are tender, about 30 minutes.
    - Serve the gumbo on top of cooked rice and add parsley or green onions to top.
